## Recursive Queries in SQL


ðŸ“Œ Overview

Recursive queries in SQL are a special type of query that reference themselves to solve problems involving hierarchies, sequences, or iterative calculations. They are most commonly written using Common Table Expressions (CTEs) with the WITH RECURSIVE (or just WITH in SQL Server) syntax.

This project demonstrates how recursive queries work, when to use them, and provides practical examples.

Recursive queries are a powerful tool when working with hierarchical or sequential data.
This repo demonstrates the fundamentals and gives you a foundation to apply recursion in real-world SQL problems.
