SQl Query Optmization
This SQL case study shows how to optimize long SQL queries. Uses of Joins, Case statements, CTEs, Windows functions are covered in this SQL script.

In this case two tables are given, Employees table to get employee information, Salary_history table to track salary changes and promotions. Task is to find :

Find the latest salary for each employee. 2.Calculate the total number of promotions each employee has received. 3.Determie the maximum salsry hike percentage between two consecutive salary chnages for each employee
identify employees whose salary has never decreased overtime.
Find the average time(in months) between salary chnages for each employee
Rank employees by their salary growth rate (From first to last recorded salary), breaking ties by earliest join date.
and Combine all the results into one output.

Here I have written a general SQL script and an optimized SQL Script
